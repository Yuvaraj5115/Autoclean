This project was built to answer a simple question: "Is this room *really* clean?" AutoClean is our solution—an autonomous system that ensures a space is not only fresh but also safe, by intelligently deciding when and how to clean.

## **✨ Key Features**

| Feature | Status | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Presence Detection** | ✅ | Uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to ensure the room is empty before operating. Safety first\! |
| **Air Quality Monitoring** | ✅ | An MQ-135 sensor "sniffs" the air for general impurities like smoke and bad odors. |
| **Gas Leak Alert** | ✅ | An MQ-4 sensor provides a critical safety alert by detecting methane or CNG leaks. |
| **Automated Disinfection** | ✅ | A relay-controlled motor activates a disinfectant spray when the room is empty and the air quality is poor. |
| **Clear Visual Feedback** | ✅ | Uses Green and Red LEDs to signal "Safe" or "Cleaning" status, with a buzzer for gas alerts. |
| **Power Efficient** | ✅ | Designed to run from a single 3.7V Li-ion battery (with a recommended boost converter). |

## **🧠 How It Works: The Logic Flow**

The system's decision-making is designed to be simple and reliable. It continuously cycles through these steps:

1. **Scan for Presence**: The HC-SR04 sensor checks if anyone is in the room.  
   * **If a person is detected**: The system enters a safe, idle state. It turns the **Green LED** ON and pauses all other functions.  
   * **If the room is empty**: It proceeds to the next step.  
2. **Check the Air**: The MQ-135 and MQ-4 sensors analyze the air.  
   * **If a methane leak is detected** (MQ-4 \> threshold): The **Buzzer** sounds an immediate alarm. This is the highest priority.  
   * **If the general air quality is poor** (MQ-135 \> threshold): The system begins the cleaning cycle. It turns the **Red LED** ON and activates the **Motor** via the relay.  
   * **If the air is clean**: The system confirms the safe state by turning the **Green LED** ON.  
3. **Repeat**: The loop starts over, ensuring constant monitoring.

## **🛠️ Hardware Required**

Here’s a complete list of the components we used to build AutoClean.

| Component | Quantity | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| ESP32 Dev Board | 1 | The brain of the operation |
| HC-SR04 Sensor | 1 | Ultrasonic presence detection |
| MQ-135 Sensor Module | 1 | General air quality sensing |
| MQ-4 Sensor Module | 1 | Methane gas detection |
| 5V Single Channel Relay | 1 | Switch for the spray motor |
| 3-6V DC Motor | 1 | Powers the disinfectant spray |
| LEDs (Red, Green) | 1 each | Visual status indicators |
| Piezo Buzzer | 1 | Audible alarm for gas alerts |
| 3.7V Li-ion Battery | 1 | Power Source |
| 5V Boost Converter | 1 | **Highly Recommended** for stable power |
| Resistors (220Ω) | 2 | Current limiting for the LEDs |
| Breadboard & Jumper Wires | Set | For assembly and connections |

## **🔌 Wiring & Connections**

Proper wiring is crucial for stable performance. We strongly recommend using a **5V boost converter** to step up the battery's 3.7V. This provides a clean 5V supply to the ESP32's VIN and the sensors, preventing unexpected brownouts, especially during Wi-Fi use.

* **Power Distribution**: The 3.7V battery connects to the boost converter's input. The converter's 5V output and GND then supply power to all other components.  
* **Common Ground**: Ensure all GND pins (ESP32, sensors, relay, motor, battery) are connected to a common ground rail.

### **Pinout Table**

| Component | Connects to ESP32 Pin | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **HC-SR04** TRIG | GPIO 25 | A standard digital output pin. |
| **HC-SR04** ECHO | GPIO 26 | **Important:** Use a voltage divider (e.g., 1kΩ/2kΩ) to step down the 5V signal to a 3.3V level safe for the ESP32. |
| **MQ-135** A0 | GPIO 36 (ADC1\_0) | Analog pin for air quality reading. |
| **MQ-4** A0 | GPIO 39 (ADC1\_3) | Analog pin for methane gas reading. |
| **Relay** IN | GPIO 27 | Digital output to trigger the motor. |
| **Red LED** (+) | GPIO 32 | Connect in series with a 220Ω resistor. |

This is the complete Arduino sketch that runs the AutoClean system.

### **Quick Setup**

1. Ensure you have the **Arduino IDE** installed.  
2. Add the **ESP32 board manager** to your IDE. You can find many tutorials online for this.  
3. In the IDE, go to Tools \> Board and select your specific ESP32 board model.  
4. Select the correct COM port under Tools \> Port.  
5. Copy the code below, paste it into the IDE, and click Upload.

## **🚀 Future Ideas**

This project is a great foundation, and we're already thinking about what could come next:

* **Get it Online:** Connect the ESP32 to Wi-Fi to send phone notifications about cleaning cycles or gas alerts.  
* **Track the Data:** Log air quality data over time to a cloud service to visualize trends.  
* **Smarter Logic:** Implement a timer so it only cleans during specific off-hours.  
* **Go Solar:** Add a small solar panel and battery management system to make it truly autonomous.
